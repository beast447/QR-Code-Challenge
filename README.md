# QR-Code-Challenge
Frontend Mentor QR code challenge. Also my first repo!

# This was my first real solo web dev project
I began coding about 3 weeks ago on freeCodeCamp and decided to challenge myself a little without someone holding my had all the way through.

It's just a simple first pproject availible on frontendmentor.io and if you're new to web development I would 100% reccomend trying it out.

I do plan on making this more responsive and adding custom fonts to it in the very near future but overall happy with the way it turned out.
